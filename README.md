# Fuel

**A Flutter Version 3.35.4**

-----

Welcome to Fuel\! This document provides essential information for developers, including instructions on how to export the project's context and guidelines for maintaining the changelog.

## üöÄ Project Context Exporter (`repomix`)

This section explains how to use the `repomix` tool to generate a single, comprehensive context file of this project. This is useful for sharing, archiving, or feeding the project's structure and code to AI models.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the `repomix` command-line tool installed and up-to-date. For complete installation and usage instructions, please refer to the official GitHub repository.

- **Official Documentation**: [https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)
- **Installation**: `npm install -g repomix`

### 2\. Configuration Options

This project includes two predefined `repomix` configurations located in the `repomix_configs/` directory.

- `repomix.lib-only.json`

    - **What it does**: Exports only the core Dart code from the `lib/` directory and the `pubspec.yaml` file.
    - **Use case**: Best for a lightweight export focusing purely on the application's logic.

- `repomix.full.json`

    - **What it does**: Exports the core library code **plus** the native configuration files for both `android` and `ios`.
    - **Use case**: Ideal for a complete project export that includes native platform setups.

### 3\. How to Export

1.  Open your terminal in the root directory of this project.
2.  Choose the appropriate command below based on your needs.
3.  Replace `"path/to/your/output.md"` with your desired output file path and name.

#### Command to Export Library Code Only

```bash
repomix -o "path/to/your/project_context.md"
```

## üì¶ Code Generation (ObjectBox)
This project uses ObjectBox as a local database. Whenever you make changes to model files (e.g., `lib/data/models/book/local_book_model.dart`), you must regenerate the necessary code using `build_runner`.

### One-Time Build
To run a single build that generates the required files, use the following command. The `--delete-conflicting-outputs` flag is recommended to prevent potential conflicts with old files.

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Watch for Changes
If you are actively developing and want the code to regenerate automatically every time you save a model file, use the `watch` command. This will keep running in your terminal until you stop it (`Ctrl + C`).

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Variables

This project uses **environment variables** to manage different configurations for `staging` and `production` environments. These variables are stored in dedicated files within the `keys/env/` directory.

### 1. Creating the Environment Files

You need to create two new files to store the environment variables for each build configuration.

- **`keys/env/.env-staging`**: For the staging environment.
- **`keys/env/.env-production`**: For the production environment.

You can create these files manually or by using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
touch keys/env/.env-staging
touch keys/env/.env-production
```

### 2. Adding Variables to the Files
Once created, you must add the required variables to each file. Ensure you fill in the values for your specific environment.

**File:** `keys/env/.env-staging`
```bash
base_url = "https://api.staging.fuelapp.com"
key_tokens = "your_staging_key_tokens"
user_cache_key = "staging_user_cache"
```

**File:** `keys/env/.env-production`
```bash
base_url = "https://api.production.fuelapp.com"
key_tokens = "your_production_key_tokens"
user_cache_key = "production_user_cache"
```

**Note:** The example values provided above are placeholders. You should replace them with the actual values for your `staging` and `production` environments.

## üîß Build Instructions for iOS and Android

- **Obfuscation:** Builds are not obfuscated by default. To enable obfuscation and upload debug symbols to Sentry, add the `--obfuscate` flag to the end of the command.

### For Android

#### Android App Bundle (AAB - Default):

- **Without Obfuscation:**
    - **Windows:** `.\scripts\build.sh [staging|production] android`
    - **Linux / macOS:** `bash scripts/build.sh [staging|production] android`
- **With Obfuscation:**
    - **Windows:** `.\scripts\build.sh [staging|production] android --obfuscate`
    - **Linux / macOS:** `bash scripts/build.sh [staging|production] android --obfuscate`

#### Android APK:

- **Without Obfuscation:**
    - **Windows:** `.\scripts\build.sh [staging|production] android apk`
    - **Linux / macOS:** `bash scripts/build.sh [staging|production] android apk`
- **With Obfuscation:**
    - **Windows:** `.\scripts\build.sh [staging|production] android apk --obfuscate`
    - **Linux / macOS:** `bash scripts/build.sh [staging|production] android apk --obfuscate`

### For iOS

**Note:** iOS release builds created with this script **must be obfuscated**. For non-obfuscated development builds, please use Xcode directly.

#### iOS IPA (Obfuscation Required):

- **Windows:** `.\scripts\build.sh [staging|production] ios --obfuscate`
- **Linux / macOS:** `bash scripts/build.sh [staging|production] ios --obfuscate`
